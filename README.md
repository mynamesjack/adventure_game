The very basic skeleton. The map is currently 4x4 but filled with placeholders (and some don't actually exist yet). It's an a1-d4 grid with the player starting at either b2 or c2- the idea being that I wanted a central starting location to give more early game choice and give the illusion of it being non-linear(haha).

Lots to do but I'm having a lot of fun. Will naturally post updates on here.
